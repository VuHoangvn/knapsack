Knapsack data and some portions of solver.py was provided in the course 
Discrete Optimization by Prof. Pascal Van Hentenryck of University of Melbourne.

My contribution was based on the lecture on the topic in the same course.
  - DP_Solver() : Dynamic Programming Solver
  - BB_Solver() : Branch and Bound Solver
  - BB_Solver_lm() : Branch and Bound Low Memory (my own extended version)
